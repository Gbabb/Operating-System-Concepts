No commands are required to run both of our schedulers. Simply double click the run_scheduler.bat that is included in this folder, and both schedulers will run.
The program is searching for a file named "datafile-txt.txt" that contains our information formatted as arrival time - burst time pairs.
If you wish to change the data to be run, ensure that the file is formatted as the example one included in this folder is.

Upon clicking the script, a file "SchedulerOutputs.txt" will be generated that includes our statistics for the runs of both schedulers.
